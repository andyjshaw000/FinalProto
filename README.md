This 2D game features a Sun celestial ninja who has the power to bend the elements of fire, earth, water, sun, and air. The ninja must defend against shadow warriors who are growing stronger and trying to attack the Sun itself. To fight these shadow warriors, the player can shoot sun orbs that damage enemies with the left mouse button and move around using the WASD keys. However, the player must be careful not to collide with the shadow warriors, as this will cause damage. As the player defeats more enemies, they'll collect experience points that can be used to level up and become even more powerful. After every few levels, the player can choose to upgrade their bending abilities or their health, speed, or defense, which will help them to defeat even more enemies and ultimately save the Sun from danger.
